Subject: RE: SDFL Epstein-related documents

Hello [REDACTED]

I can do a call this afternoon. Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow during the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don’t work, let me know and we will work out an alternate time.

In the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR has their own inventory of the materials.

When OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the documents that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the time on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well.

A copy of our inventory is attached.

I look forward to assisting you in this matter.

Best regards,

[REDACTED]
