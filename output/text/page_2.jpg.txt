Subject: SDFL Epstein-related documents

We supervise the team in New York that is currently prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell, and [REDACTED] suggested we reach out to you. As discussed briefly with [REDACTED], we are hoping to locate the boxes of documents and other records regarding the prior SDFL investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators that we understand are currently being stored in the West Palm Beach office. In particular, we would like to make arrangements to review and scan those materials in connection with our own case, and [REDACTED] suggested that we touch base with you on how best to do so.

I’ve copied the trial team here. Please let us know if you have time for a call in the near future to discuss further. Alternatively, if there is a more appropriate point of contact on this issue, please feel free to point us in that direction.

Thanks very much,

[REDACTED]
