Thank you very much for looking into this and for all of your help. For now, we would like to look into having a vendor scan the entire file and make copies of any CDs and cassette tapes in the files. Would you be able to send us the names of vendors you have used in the past please?

Best,

Sorry it took time to get back to you. In answer to the questions from the call.

1. You are welcome to come to our office in West Palm Beach. We can set up a floor where you will be reasonably alone and can safely scan materials. There is a Marriott within a block of our office if you decide to come.

2. Turns out we cancelled our copy service earlier this year and never got it going again due to Covid. I can get names of vendors we used in the past if you want to go that route.

3. There are cds and cassette tape in the materials according to the legal assistant that has done the inventory.

Feel free to contact me with any other questions.

Best regards
